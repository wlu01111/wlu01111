<div align="justify"> The 4th International Symposium Quantitative Pharmacology in Drug Development and Regulation (ISQP), held at Tiantan Hotel in Beijing from November 1st to 3rd 2013, was a huge success. This symposium was jointly organized by Mathematical Pharmacology Professional Committee of China (Chinese Pharmacological Society), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Peking University, and State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs (Peking University), and supported by International Society of Pharmacometrics (ISoP). With over 300 experts (including President-Elect and several senior members of ISoP, Vice Presidents and other senior management from Pfizer, Janssen R&D, Roche, etc.) in drug regulatory authorities, industry and academia from China, US, UK, France, Belgium, New Zealand, India, Japan and other countries and regions in attendance, the opportunities, challenges, hot topics, latest academic thoughts and research findings in Pharmacometrics were discussed in depth.
</div>
<div align="justify">Prof. Wei, Lu, Chairman of the Symposium, Prof. Junyi Liu, Dean of the School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of PKU, Prof. Ruiyuan Sun, Honorary Chairman of the Symposium, and Dr. Sharma Amarnath, Vice President of Quantitative Sciences in Janssen R&D gave a warm welcome speech in turn to kick off the meeting.
</div>
<div align="justify">The conference program consisted of invited plenary lectures and poster sessions of unsolicited contributions. 40 invited scholars and experts from China and abroad delivered excellent speeches on: (1) Impact of Model-based Methods on Drug Development Strategy and Clinical Trial Design, (2) Application and Emerging Technologies of Quantitative Pharmacology, (3) PK/PD and Disease Progression Modeling, Discovery of Biomarker and its Quantitative Analysis, (4) Therapeutic Drug Monitoring and Model-based Dosing Individualization, (5) Clinical Trial Design and PK/PD Modeling and Simulation Case Studies in Drug Development, (6) Ethnicity Sensitivity Assessment and Clinical Bridging: Quantitative Design and Case Study, (7) Model-based Meta-analysis (MBMA), (8) Application of Model Based Approaches for the Development of Biological Drugs. Many young and middle-aged researchers with vigor and vitality also exhibited recent research findings in Pharmacometrics.
</div>
<div align="justify">Prof. Wei Lu was elected to serve for another term as the Vice Chairman of the Mathematical Pharmacology Professional Committee of China during the symposium.
</div>
<div align="justify">The symposium was financially supported by Pfizer, Janssen, Roche, Amgen, ISoP, Bionovo, AB SCIEX, Neotrident and other famous domestic and foreign companies. Janssen sponsored “Poster Excellence Award” to encourage meritorious and talented young scientists. 
This conference was unanimously acknowledged and highly appreciated by audiences for high-profile experts, innovative topics and heated discussions. ISQP also provided a platform for discipline construction, academic exchange, and talent cultivation, and will have a positive impact on Pharmacometrics, new drug research and development in China.</div>

                                <br>
								<p >
								Pharmacometrics is a new comprehensive discipline in the field of pharmaceutical sciences. It consists of Bio-pharmaceutics, Pharmacokinetics, Population pharmacokinetics, Pharmaco-<br>kinetics/pharmacodynamics, Computational mathematics and Regulation of drugs.<br><br>
								Through Pharmacometrics one can quantify the uncertainty of information about model behavior and rationalize knowledge-driven decision which are made in the drug development process and clinical uses of drugs. In 2004, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the US put forward the Model Based Drug Development (MBDD) in the critical path documents. Today, the use of pharmacometric approaches is at the heart of MBDD. <br><br>
								Peking University Pharmacometrics Research Group (PKUPK) was founded in 2003. The faculty in PKUPK includes one professor, one associate professor and one lecturer. Every year, we recruit one postdoctoral fellow, 1~2 Ph.D. students, 3~4 Master students, and 1~2 visiting students. Until 2013, one postdoctoral fellow, 19 Ph.D.s and 23 Masters were graduated from PKUPK. Now they are either admitted to Ph.D. or postdoctoral programs further in world famous universities, or working in the field of drug research and development in large or medium-sized pharmaceutical enterprises, or working in the universities or hospitals, respectively. Some of them have got outstanding achievements in this field.<br><br>
								Nowadays, PKUPK has gained recognition at home and abroad. It is a co-chair institution in the International Advisory Board in the International Society of Pharmacometrics (ISoP). Supported by Pfizer Inc., PKUPK established Peking University/Pfizer Pharmacometrics Education Center (PKU/Pfizer PMxEC) in 2008. Besides, PKUPK is also cooperating closely with other pharmaceutical industries, as well as clinical institutions in China. Today, PKUPK is playing a significant role in pharmacometric research through joint training of high-end talent, academic and personal exchanges and hosting international conferences. It prepares for the society a much-needed pharmacometric talent in the field of new drug R&D in China.<br></p> </div>

<div align="justify"> The 4th International Symposium Quantitative Pharmacology in Drug Development and Regulation (ISQP), held at Tiantan Hotel in Beijing from November 1st to 3rd 2013, was a huge success. This symposium was jointly organized by Mathematical Pharmacology Professional Committee of China (Chinese Pharmacological Society), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Peking University, and State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs (Peking University), and supported by International Society of Pharmacometrics (ISoP). With over 300 experts (including President-Elect and several senior members of ISoP, Vice Presidents and other senior management from Pfizer, Janssen R&D, Roche, etc.) in drug regulatory authorities, industry and academia from China, US, UK, France, Belgium, New Zealand, India, Japan and other countries and regions in attendance, the opportunities, challenges, hot topics, latest academic thoughts and research findings in Pharmacometrics were discussed in depth.
</div>
<div align="justify">Prof. Wei, Lu, Chairman of the Symposium, Prof. Junyi Liu, Dean of the School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of PKU, Prof. Ruiyuan Sun, Honorary Chairman of the Symposium, and Dr. Sharma Amarnath, Vice President of Quantitative Sciences in Janssen R&D gave a warm welcome speech in turn to kick off the meeting.
</div>
<div align="justify">The conference program consisted of invited plenary lectures and poster sessions of unsolicited contributions. 40 invited scholars and experts from China and abroad delivered excellent speeches on: (1) Impact of Model-based Methods on Drug Development Strategy and Clinical Trial Design, (2) Application and Emerging Technologies of Quantitative Pharmacology, (3) PK/PD and Disease Progression Modeling, Discovery of Biomarker and its Quantitative Analysis, (4) Therapeutic Drug Monitoring and Model-based Dosing Individualization, (5) Clinical Trial Design and PK/PD Modeling and Simulation Case Studies in Drug Development, (6) Ethnicity Sensitivity Assessment and Clinical Bridging: Quantitative Design and Case Study, (7) Model-based Meta-analysis (MBMA), (8) Application of Model Based Approaches for the Development of Biological Drugs. Many young and middle-aged researchers with vigor and vitality also exhibited recent research findings in Pharmacometrics.
</div>
<div align="justify">Prof. Wei Lu was elected to serve for another term as the Vice Chairman of the Mathematical Pharmacology Professional Committee of China during the symposium.
</div>
<div align="justify">The symposium was financially supported by Pfizer, Janssen, Roche, Amgen, ISoP, Bionovo, AB SCIEX, Neotrident and other famous domestic and foreign companies. Janssen sponsored “Poster Excellence Award” to encourage meritorious and talented young scientists. 
This conference was unanimously acknowledged and highly appreciated by audiences for high-profile experts, innovative topics and heated discussions. ISQP also provided a platform for discipline construction, academic exchange, and talent cultivation, and will have a positive impact on Pharmacometrics, new drug research and development in China.</div>

								<p>Pharmacometrics is a new discipline based on traditional pharmacokinetics. It includes Population Pharmacokinetics (PopPK), as well as Pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) modeling and simulation. It has become a mainstream in pharmacokinetic research in the developed countries. The application of pharmacometrics can be summarized as two aspects: New drug research and development (R&D), and rationalizing clinical uses of drugs.<br><br>
Nowadays, the pharmacometrics research in China is still in its infancy. However, with increased focus to international drug research standards and popularization of knowledge, pharmacometrics in China will get a significant development in the near future. Based on the development prospects of pharmacometrics, pharmaceutical companies and research institutions at home and abroad have greater needs in relevant talents. Facing to these needs, Peking University/Pfizer Pharmacometrics Education Center was established on March 4th 2008, a multi-year collaboration between Peking University’s Health Science Center (PUHSC) and Pfizer (China), to promote the education of talented Chinese scientists in pharmacometrics, which is a critically important technical area in drug research and development. This collaboration is intended to increase the number of qualified Chinese graduate students being trained in the discipline as well as the number of trained faculties in the field. Currently, 7 Ph.D. students and 1 post-doctor fellow have been supported by Pfizer Scholarship for PMxEC. Pharmacometrics is an applied science, and Pfizer provides students access to real life data sets to help them develop and apply their modeling and simulation skills. Pfizer experts also provide seminars and advice to students and faculties in this program.<br><br>
The Education Center has a close connection with school’s teaching and researching programs, and offers complete curriculum, with structured instruction of pharmacometrics, including population pharmacokinetics, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), non-linear pharmacokinetics, physiologically based pharmacokinetics, and modeling & simulation in drug development. Beside the theories, students here have full opportunities to use the mainstream software like NONMEM for modeling and simulating of the real life data sets. Our Center has taken on several national projects and is the lead unit of the drug metabolism sub-platform in one of the 11th National Five-Year Project-Comprehensive Platform of Novel Drug Development. Our research interests are on the theory and methodology of clinical pharmacology and new drug evaluation. Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics are the main fields, including in vivo and in vitro PK/PD modeling, response surface model for drug-drug interaction, database for TDM, and so on.
